# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
The HR Department at Pewlett Hackard needed an analysis to determine the number of staff eligible for retirement broken down by department and title. the analysis is necessary to anticipate personnel changes due to retirement and implement mitigation action to insure the continuity of operation should all eligible staff retire to include a mentorship program.

## Results:
90,398 Of the 300,024 employees within the company, are eligible for retirement. 30% of the total staff are eligible for retirement. Of the staff eligible 64% of them hold positions above a general staff level. 
The breakdown of staff eligible for retirement by title below depicts the liability Pewlett Hackard is facing if they do not mitigate the impact of the retirement class. As depicted majority of the retiring staff holds highly trained positions.
## Retiring by Title Table:

There are currently 1941 staff eligible for the mentorship program.

## Summary:
Biased on the analysis Pewlett Hackard if facing a retirement wave of over 90,000 position and currently only has 1941 staff members eligible to train to the fill these positions. They are experiencing a large gap in backfills. 
I would suggest further analyzing the gap you have relative to each department.  The departments with the largest gaps in backfill will help determine the urgency of hiring new staff. Two other factors I would consider is impact of the vacant position and age of the staff eligible for retirement. Then hiring could be prioritized by age ( most likely to retire first), Deficit in trainable staff, and impact the position remaining vacant to operations.
